 ## Wallpaper changer

 This is a program developed in python that changes the wallpaper of the __Windows__ desktop.

- The program accesses the images folder located in: __"C:\Users\User\Pictures\wallpapers"__.

__Note:__ For better public use, the future version will ask the user where to take the images from and save it.


### Future updates:
- An actual GUI that will let the user preview the picture
- slight probabilty of the program being rewrited in rust


 __Requirements:__ This program requires the library __inquirer__ for the choice handling.
